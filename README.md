For Developers
===============
Building your own version
-------------
To build a modified and signed version of this extension, simply run build.sh.


Setting up your Environment
-------
You'll probably want a Firefox dev environment set up. This gets complicated,
but there are some great resources out there. As more details are collected,
please update this section.

To set up a Firefox dev environment:

1. Follow [the instructions on Mozilla's website][mdn] for setting up a development
   profile. You can mostly ignore the extensions that it wants you to install.

Tips
-----
1. Once you've got the settings above in place, you can debug the browser XUL
and JavaScript by going to Tools > Web Developer > Browser Toolbox.
